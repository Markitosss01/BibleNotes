                   Daniel was brought into Babylon at 16 due to Israels captivity, and since he was wise, good-looking and very smart with the ability to understand quickly he served in the kings court.
                   God used Daniel to interpert dreams and visions, which I now understand that the dreams in this book are referring to human history which have already, mostly, occured.
                   Some are yet to happen but we are very close! 
               </p> 
               <p>I want to examine this book and lead into Revelation because there is a major, extremely huge, and astonoshing prophetic revelation and understanding of world history that has already happened in the past but its been prophesied in these 2 books, even to declare the rise of the United States of America which is the country
                   I live in and deeply cherish and love. I don't know if that is wrong in the sight of God but I appreciate living here, and for being alive in such an era as this. Yet, there is more to happen and many things are unfolding in these times, but they are all written, and this country is the last nation before the ever-lasting kingdom of Christ shall be established!
                   <br> <br> I will do my best to take notes on each chapter to later break them down in my overall recview

                   Jehoiakim was king of Judah for 3 years when Nebuchadnezzer, king of Babylon, besieged Jerusalem. <br> <br>
                   I find it interesting how it says that the Lord gave Judah's king, Jehoiakim, into the hands of the Babylonians, because basically the Lord allowed it to happen, but he is God and who are we to question. Im sure this was due to Isreals rebellion in which the Lord has allowed other nations to over take them before.<br>

                  Daniel, Hananiah, Misheal, and Azariah were brought to the king among many other young men who were smart, wise and quick-witted so that they might serve the king of Babylon.<br> <br>
                   Daniel, a man of God, did not want to defile himself with the wine and foods of the king, so he asked to not partake. Daniel found favor in the sight of the chief eunuch appointed over him and the other three, and was allowed to test for 10 days if his food was better than the king's foods for their health.
                   Daniel requested vegetables and water and at the end of the 10 days, the appearance of Daniel, Hananiah, Misheal, and Azariah were better than those who ate the kings foods and wine. The 4 were allowed to eat their food instead of the kings.<br>
                   <br> God gave Daniel, Hananiah, Misheal, and Azariah knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. <br>
                   At the end of the 3 years, the king found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Misheal, and Azariah, therefore they served before the king. In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.

                   King Nebuchadnezzer had a dream that troubled his spirit and would not allow him to sleep, so he called the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the chaldeans to make known the dream without the king telling it,
                   and to give its interpertation. The chaldeans told the king that what he asked was impossible, and that no man has ever done anything like that. This caused the king to become very angry and furious, so he gave the command 
                   that every wise men should be killed, and they went to look for Daniel and his friends to kill them. <br>
                   <br> Daniel asked Arioch, the captain of the guards why they were doing these things, so Arioch told Daniel the reason, and Daniel asked the king to give him time. So Daniel went to his house and told Hananiah, Misheal, and Azariah, and they began to pray 
                   to seek mercy from God concering this dream, and that they may not die with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. Then God revelead the secret of the dream to Daniel in a night vision. <br> <br>
                   So Daniel was brought to the king by Arioch, and he told him that the God of heaven who reveals secrets had made known to him what would be in the last days.  </p>

                   <p >The king saw a great image with an excellent splendor that stood before him. The head of the image was fine gold. Its chest and arms were silver. Its belly and thighs were bronze. Its legs were of iron, and its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.
                   The king watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. All the 4 elements were crushed together, and became like chaff, and the wind carried them away without a trace and the 
                   stone the struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. </p>

                King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of Gold and commanded all the people in the nation to worship when the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre and psaltery in symohony with all kinds of music was played. 
                And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
